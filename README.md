# sveltekit-example-template

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) skeleton project which I use as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for creating repositories with SvelteKit examples.

They run on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) without additional configuration. Both platforms install dependencies automatically, run `npm run dev` and launch a preview. StackBlitz projects can be [embedded in posts](https://developer.stackblitz.com/docs/platform/embedding/).
