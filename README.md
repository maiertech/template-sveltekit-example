# template-sveltekit-example

You probably don't need this template and should just run `npx sv create`.

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) minimal project, which I use as a
[GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
to speed up my workflow when creating screencasts.

## Keeping dependencies up-to-date

I update dependencies in this template regularly. Run `npx sv create` to regenerate a minimal
SvelteKit project into the existing directory.

### Where would you like your project to be created?

### Which template would you like?

## Debugging

Just launch the application in the
[JavaScript Debug Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-javascript-debug-terminal).
